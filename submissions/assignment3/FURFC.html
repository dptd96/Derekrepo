<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Fordham University Rugby Football Club celebrated its 50th Anniversary Season in 2012, making it one of the oldest rugby teams in New York City. FURFC's stated mission is to display a commitment through strength of effort embodied in physical perseverance and mental determination. Fordham Rugby embodies the values of collaboration, dedication, and individual responsibility to the whole in all aspects of life. In recent years, an additional emphasis on community service has reinforced the Club's commitment to the University's Jesuit ideals. FURFC is often referred to as "The Bronx's Oldest and Toughest Brotherhood." This is exemplified by many FURFC alumni who go on to participate in Fordham's Old Maroon Rugby Football Club which is based out of the Bronx as well. Notable alumni include Ryan McTiernan, Edward Cullen, and Mike Durant(all former USA U-20 Eag as well as Tony Reali (host of ESPN Around the Horn).</p>
